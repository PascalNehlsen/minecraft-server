### Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Docker Compose has been integrated into Docker as a plugin as of Docker version 20.10.
If not, [visit official Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker compose manually.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PascalNehlsen/minecraft-server
   cd minecraft-server
   ```

2. Copy the content of the example env file into a .env file:

   ```bash
   cp example_env .env
   ```

3. Build the Docker image and Start the Minecraft server container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Access your Minecraft server:

   - Open Minecraft and connect to `localhost:8888` (or use your server's IP if hosted remotely).

5. To stop the server, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
