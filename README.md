## Description

This repository offers a Docker Compose configuration for hosting a Minecraft server. The setup simplifies launching, managing, and customizing a Minecraft server.

Key features:

- **Containerized Deployment**: Run your server reliably using Docker.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust memory allocation, player limits, game modes, and more.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Start, stop, and update your server with minimal effort.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Docker Compose is included with Docker 20.10 and later. If you have an older version, follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker Compose as a plugin.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PascalNehlsen/minecraft-server
   cd minecraft-server
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file from the example configuration:

   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```

3. Build and start the server container:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. Open Minecraft and connect to the server:

   - Local server: `localhost:8888` (or use your server's IP if hosted remotely).

5. To stop the server, use:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
